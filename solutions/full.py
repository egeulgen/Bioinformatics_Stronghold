    Given: A list L containing 2n+3 positive real numbers (nâ‰¤100). The first number in L is the parent mass of a peptide 
    P, and all other numbers represent the masses of some b-ions and y-ions of P (in no particular order). You may 
    assume that if the mass of a b-ion is present, then so is that of its complementary y-ion, and vice-versa.
    Return: A protein string t of length n for which there exist two positive real numbers w1 and w2 such that for every 
    prefix p and suffix s of t, each of w(p)+w1 and w(s)+w2 is equal to an element of L. (In other words, there exists a
    protein string whose t-prefix and t-suffix weights correspond to the non-parent mass values of L.) If multiple 
    solutions exist, you may output any one.
